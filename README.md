# Vehicle Path Tracking Extension

## About

Path tracking extension allows an instance of omni.physxvehicle to
follow a defined path (Usd BasisCurves) via a path tracking algorithm inspired
by a classic Pure Pursuit algorithm.

### Limitations

* Pure Pursuit Tracking algorithm is kinematic based and does not take into 
account allo of the vehicle physics dynamics, such as tire slipping etc.
* No unit tests; occasional bugs might exist.
